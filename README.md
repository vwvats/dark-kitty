# Dark Kitty
An animated kitty that tells dark jokes on the click of a button.

## Objectives
My learning objectives for this project were to become proficient in trigerring asynchronous events (on user input) as well as interacting with REST APIs. Dark Kitty uses fetch to first get a joke in JSON format from a Joke API and then passes it into a text-to-speech SDK that outputs an audio when the user clicks on the 'Tell Joke' button.
